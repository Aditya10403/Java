# Getting Started with Java 👨🏻‍💻

## Introduction to Java
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based and object-oriented.

## Types of Java Platforms

Java platforms are categorized into:

- **Java SE**: For developing desktop and server applications with rich user interfaces, portability, and security.
- **Java EE**: Provides an API and runtime for large, scalable, and secure enterprise applications.
- **Java ME**: Tailored for resource-constrained devices like wireless modules and industrial controls.
- **JavaFX**: A platform for building rich internet applications with a lightweight UI API.

## Getting Started with Java

1. **Install JDK**: Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH`.
3. **Choose an IDE**: Use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).


## Core Java Concepts
Core Java refers to the standard edition of Java (Java SE) and consists of the basic features of the Java programming language.

### <a name="1-what-is-java">What is Java?</a>
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, and object-oriented. The advantages of object-oriented software development are shown below:

- Modular development of code, which leads to easy maintenance and modification.
- Reusability of code.
- Improved reliability and flexibility of code.
- Increased understanding of code.

### <a name="2-features-of-java">Features of Java</a>
Some of the features which play an important role in the popularity of Java are as follows:

- Object-Oriented
- Platform independent
- High Performance
- Multithreaded
- Portable
- Secure

Sample code in Java:

```java
public class FirstProgram{
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System.out.println("Sita Ram 🙏");  
    }  
}
```
