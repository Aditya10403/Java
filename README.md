# Getting Started with Java üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

The Green Team, consisting of James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, initiated the Java language project in June 1991.

## Types of Java Platforms

Java platforms are categorized into:

- **Java SE**: For developing desktop and server applications with rich user interfaces, portability, and security.
- **Java EE**: Provides an API and runtime for large, scalable, and secure enterprise applications.
- **Java ME**: Tailored for resource-constrained devices like wireless modules and industrial controls.
- **JavaFX**: A platform for building rich internet applications with a lightweight UI API.

## Getting Started with Java

1. **Install JDK**: Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH`.
3. **Choose an IDE**: Use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).


## Core Java Concepts
Core Java refers to the standard edition of Java (Java SE) and consists of the basic features of the Java programming language.

### <a name="1-what-is-java">What is Java?</a>
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, and object-oriented. The advantages of object-oriented software development are shown below:

- Modular development of code, which leads to easy maintenance and modification.
- Reusability of code.
- Improved reliability and flexibility of code.
- Increased understanding of code.

### <a name="2-features-of-java">Features of Java</a>
Some of the features which play an important role in the popularity of Java are as follows:

- Object-Oriented
- Platform independent
- High Performance
- Multithreaded
- Portable
- Secure

Sample code in Java:

```java
public class FirstProgram{
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System.out.println("Sita Ram üôè");  
    }  
}
```
